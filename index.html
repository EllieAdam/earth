    <h2>Story about mother Earth</h2>
    <img src="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2013/05/tornado-moore-OK-5-20-2013-NASA-whole-earth-e1369170216124.jpg" alt="Earth">
<P>Earth, our home planet, is the only planet in our solar system known to harbor life. All of the things we need to survive are provided under a thin layer of atmosphere that separates us from the uninhabitable void of space. Earth is made up of complex, interactive systems that are often unpredictable. Air, water, land, and life—including humans—combine forces to create a constantly changing world that we are striving to understand.

  Viewing Earth from the unique perspective of space provides the opportunity to see Earth as a whole. Scientists around the world have discovered many things about our planet by working together and sharing their findings.</P>

<h3>Fact About Earth</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The speed at which the Earth travels around the sun is over 100 times faster than the average speed of a commercial aeroplane.</li>
    <li>Just 0.01% of all creatures that have ever been alive on Earth are still in existence today.</li>
    <li>Early hominins, ancestors of modern humans, were much shorter than we are today. On average, we now stand 1.4ft taller than our now extinct predecessors.</li>
    <li>Despite the fact that around 70% of the world is covered by water, only 3% of this water is drinkable. The rest is simply too salty.</li>
    <li>Argentinosaurus, from the late cretaceous period, is currently considered the largest mammal (and dinosaur) to have ever existed on Earth. It is almost twice as tall as a giraffe and is thought to weigh more than 15 African Elephants.</li>
    <li>Scientists reckon that 30,000 species are becoming extinct each year. That means that every 20 minutes a species is vanishing off the Earth forever.</li>
    <li>The length of a Blue Whale, the largest mammal currently in existence on Earth, is over 20 metres long.</li>
    <li>If all humans on Earth were lined up head to toe, they would stretch to the moon and back 15 times.</li>
    <li>The Earth has a mass over eighty times larger than the mass of the moon.</li>
    <li>Your weight is different on other planets, on Mars your weight is a third of that on Earth, whereas on Jupiter it is over double. On the Sun your weight would be almost thirty times larger than it is on Earth!</li>
    <li>It would take almost 350 days to walk non-stop around the surface of the Earth at its equator, a distance of 25,000 miles, if you walked at an average pace of 3mph.</li>
    <li>Surprisingly, the strongest animal on the planet is the rhinoceros beetle who can lift up to 850 times its own body weight.</li>
    <li>The length of one day on Jupiter is equivalent to almost half a year on Earth.</li>
    <li>The largest flying animal was most likely the Quetzalcoatlus. This flying pterosaur who lived amongst the dinosaurs had a wingspan of 12 meters which would have enabled it to soar across vast distances.</li>
